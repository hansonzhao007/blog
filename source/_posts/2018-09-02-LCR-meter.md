This is my master thesis project. I need to design a LCM meter which is used to measure the impedance of electronic components, such as capacitance, inductance.

Basically this device generates a sinusoidal signal which is applied to the target component. Then it measures the voltage and current on that component and calculates it impedance.

I am in charge of the circuit design and CLPD program design, C++ interface design.
